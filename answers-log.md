temporarily disable collection of liquids (e.g. to not anger the Erchius Ghost by accidentally collecting Liquid Erchius Fuel while mining Moonstone/Moondust),
temporarily replace some functions of your Matter Manipulator (like Paint or Scan) with some other tool or weapon (e.g. Gravity Wand or Void-Warp Locus).
replace the basic Matter Manipulator with a highly advanced Manipulator (like Morphite Manipulator or Quantum Manipulator).

Holding Shift and left-clicking opens Research interface (here you "unlock" the recipes to craft new items).

Left-click[edit]

Left-click opens a menu with:

Information about player, bonuses/penalties of the chosen race, resistances to damage types, temporary immunities, etc.
GPS: information about current planet: its weather, gravity, biomes, surface dungeons, etc.
Tool to create mobility Techs like Microsphere or Phase Sprint, and tool to equip them.
Tool to refuel your Mech.
Tool to replace weapons, thrusters, etc. on your Mech.
Tool to upgrade all weapons/armors (for Upgrade Modules, up to tier 6) and tools (for Manipulator Modules, to the maximum tier that the tool supports).
Codex reader (it's more convenient than usual codex reader of Starbound, and also doesn't truncate long pages).
Right-click[edit]

Right-click opens the list of Tutorial quests (you can accept these quests in Tricorder without going to any NPCs). Not only can they be a guidance to new player, they also have some good rewards. It's a good idea to sometimes check if your current situation (discovered resources, etc.) allows you to complete some of them.

Shift + right-click[edit]
Tricorder also allows to configure the Matter Manipulator (hold Shift and right-click):

temporarily reduce 5x5 mining area (e.g. to 3x3 or 2x2) when you are building delicate houses and don't want to accidentally remove the blocks that you don't intend to remove,
temporarily disable collection of liquids (e.g. to not anger the Erchius Ghost by accidentally collecting Liquid Erchius Fuel while mining Moonstone/Moondust),
temporarily replace some functions of your Matter Manipulator (like Paint or Scan) with some other tool or weapon (e.g. Gravity Wand or Void-Warp Locus).
replace the basic Matter Manipulator with a highly advanced Manipulator (like Morphite Manipulator or Quantum Manipulator).
How it looks (main tab of Tricorder).
The Quickbar (if you have either Stardust Core Light or Stardust Core mod) gives fast access to its primary and secondary features, but not its MM Config features.

Based on the provided context, I couldn't find any information about gelatinous planets. The context only mentions specific types of planets and moons, such as Sulphuric, Mountainous, Unknown, Strange Sea, Volcanic Primeval, and others, but gelatinous planets are not mentioned.

If you're looking for information on gelatinous planets, I suggest checking other sources or searching for additional context. If you have any further questions or clarification, I'll do my best to assist you.

These are all planets in FU and vanilla.

"Tier" is the same as "fauna threat". It will affect the strength of monsters, available ores (e.g. tier 3 Titanium Ore won't be on tier 2 planets) and tier of randomly generated weapons (if/when they drop from defeated enemies).
Light level only matters for Solar Panels. Planets with "worst light level" of 0.75 or greater are perfect for solar power (4W from each Solar Panel). See also: Weather Beacon.
Gravity 80 is "normal" (same as on the starting Garden planet). Some planets have fixed gravity (e.g. 55-80 for Crystalline). If gravity for some planet type is not listed, it means that gravity depends exclusively on the size of the planet.
